    <p> Ninety miles outside of our nation’s capital stands a jewel in the crown of tri-state area dirt track racing: Hagerstown Speedway. Born during the boom of the post-World War II era of reinvigoration for motorsport, a track for junkers and truly stock car runners has grown into a place where 600 horsepower Super Late Models go door to door on the half-mile clay, while pure and hobby stocks bang doors and rub fenders under a cloudless summer night’s sky.  This is the story of the jewel in the mountains.</p>


<p class= "section"><a name="History">The History of "Hub City" </p></a>

    <p class= "chapter1"> Engineers from the war, who had plied their trade to keep America’s war machine running, where coming home and applying those very same skills to their cars to make them go faster. Of course, when one person builds a car that can go fast, another person wants to build one that goes faster than him, and so on and so forth.
    </p>

    <p class= "chapter1"> Obviously, an outlet for showing off their marvels of engineering would be needed, and places for people to come and watch this contest of skill and speed take place would need to be constructed. From this need, places like the Hagerstown Speedway were built.
    </p>

    <p class= "chapter1"> Hagerstown Speedway began operations in 1947, when track founder Stanley Schetrompf built the speedway beside the banks of the Conococheague Creek. The track, built at the infancy of the nation’s need for speed, would grow with the sport over its 72-year history.

    <p class= "chapter1">During the 40s and 50s, the Speedway hosted races for stock cars and Modifieds to strut their stuff. In the 60s, ownership of the race track shifted from Schetrompf to the Stouffer family, and as the holder of the reigns on the speedway changed, so did the cars.

    <p> The Modified Coupes that were sliding around the ½ mile of clay became smaller, turning into Super Modifieds and eventually into the modern-day Sprint Cars we’ve come to know and love.

    <p>Stock Cars went through a similar metamorphosis, going from glorified street cars to Semi-Late Models and Modern Stocks before becoming the purely race-bred Super Late Model division.</p>

    <p>With evolving cars came evolving speeds, and with higher speeds came bigger crowds, and Hagerstown was one of the first tracks in the tri-state (Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania) area to modernize to handle the needs of a growing racing culture. </p>

    <p>Larger grandstands and concessions stands were built to accommodate more people and keep them fed, larger bathrooms to efficiently handle the call of nature for such a large crowd, and the adoption of electronic scoring made it easier to keep track of the position of each car on track, and make determining a winner a simpler, less time consuming process compared to scoring by hand. </p>

    <p>From the Stouffers came Frank Plessinger in 1981 to take the track into the modern day, and now a variety of classes take to the Hagerstown Clay on any given Saturday Night. </p>

    <p>Outside of the three weekly racing classes of Pure Stock, Hobby Stock, and Late Model Sportsman, Super Late Models, 305, 358, and 410 Sprint Cars, and circle track racing’s oldest category, Modified take to the track for a series of regionally and nationally sanction ed events run at the speedway. </p>

    <p class= "chapter1">The current crop of cars that run at the Hagerstown Speedway are the Xenith of 70 years of research and development into what makes a race car go fast. We’ll take a look at a sampling of these speed machines.</p>

    <p class= "Chapter1">Late Model Sportsman and Super Late Models are the top-billed classes at the Hagerstown Speedway. Defined as the “Latest Model” of a car on the street, the term in dirt track racing defines a full-fendered race car built more for speed than grocery getting. </p>

    <p class= "chapter1"> Late Models have ramp-like noses to help cut through the air, with flat sides and a large, angled aluminum or Lexan piece called a spoiler. The purpose of the spoiler is to help generate downforce (literally defined as the amount of force pushing down on a vehicle based on its aerodynamic characteristics) to keep the cars planted to the ground. </p>

    <p class="chapter1"> At one-point, Late Model bodies did resemble their real-world counterparts, but as time went by, the cars have become less and less like the cars you’d see on the show room floor. Now, the only way you’d know a Chevy Late Model from a Ford is the stickers where the grill is supposed to be. </p>

    <p class="chapter1">The chassis and bodies are also significantly different between on the road stock cars and purpose-built dirt late models.  Where modern cars are built as a unibody (the metal frame and the body are built as one), Dirt Late Models are constructed out of a tubular chassis with a body panels bolted overtop.

	   <p class="chapter1">Not only does this make the car lighter and faster, it also makes repairs easier, as a body panel can be unbolted and a new one put in its place. </p>

     <p class="chapter1">Late Model rulesets have become mostly standardized over the years, with rule sets  based on those from the big two Super Late Model sanctioning bodies: The World of Outlaws  sanctioning body that runs at the speedway. Hagerstown Speedway uses the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series (LOLMDS) rulebook as the basis for its rules in Late Model Sportsman, with more rules for the engine and carburetor for the Sportsmans to keep costs to a minimum. </p>

<p class="section"> The "Real" Stock Cars </p>

     <p class="chapter1"> The other two points-paying classes at Hagerstown are the hotly contested Pure Stock and Hobby Stock classes. These classes look almost identical to the cars you’d see on the streets with heavy modification to make them race ready.</p>

     <p class= "chapter1"> The other two points-paying classes at Hagerstown are the hotly contested Pure Stock and Hobby Stock classes. These classes look almost identical to the cars you’d see on the streets with heavy modification to make them race ready.</p>

     <p class="chapter1"> Pure Stocks are the more race-like cars of the stock classes, allowing a bit more under the hood and on the bodies than the Hobby Stock rules allow. Keeping the cars more in line with road cars keeps the costs down significantly compared to a late mode, which allows for a more consistent car count during the season. </p>

     <p class="chapter1"> Dillion Wilson, a nine-year veteran who currently competes in the Pure Stock division, is one of those drivers you’ll see every week at Hagerstown. When asked what made the class so attractive to him, Wilson cited the class’ more down home nature as one of his reasons: </p>

     <p class="chapter1"> “Pure Stocks are attractive to me because it’s more of a grass roots class, taking stock production vehicles with close to stock type suspension and making them perform in ways they were never meant to.” </p>

      <br>

     <p class= "chapter1">Hobby Stocks are the entry level of the stock classes, which has a ruleset much more constrictive than their racier big brothers. Interiors, bodies, tires, engines and more are all highly regulated and scrutinized by officials. </p>



     <p class= "chapter1">This constrictive rule-making has a point. A tight lock of the rulebook in theory keeps the playing field level and the costs, a dubious four-letter word that has become a talking point over the last decade, to a minimum. However, as we'll see in the next section, keeping costs down is harder than it looks. </p>
