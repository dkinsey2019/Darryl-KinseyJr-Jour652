                            I am a Masters of Journalism student at the University of Maryland, studying Multi-Platform Journalism in order to enhance my skills, and prepare myself for a career in Motorsports Journalism. I currently work at WBGR Sports and Entertainment Network in Lanham, Maryland, where I have covered everything from the NFL to NASCAR at the Pocono Raceway. Outside of work, I host "The Extra Mile", a motor sports podcast that airs every Thursday at 8pm on spreaker.com/iesportsradio. From 2017 to February of 2019, I served as play by play for men's women's basketball for Bowie State University. In February of 2018, I had the honor of covering my first CIAA Tournament, and lent my voice as on air talent in a color commentary role for Bowie's state semi-final and finals appearances.
